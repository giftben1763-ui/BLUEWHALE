# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added `WarningSeverity` (`info`, `warn`, `error`) constants for comparing
  `Warning.severity` / `RoutingWarning.severity`. The values are unchanged.
- `bluewhale_core.dart` no longer leaks the internal `uint64Max` and
  `digitsOnly` top-level helpers. Use `SafeRoutingId.uint64Max` instead.
- Every public API now has Dartdoc, with examples for `detect`, `parse`,
  `validate`, `extractRouting`, `extractRoutingSync`, `StellarAddress`, and
  `MuxedAddress`. Corrected the `detect` examples, which used invalid
  addresses. The `public_member_api_docs` lint is now enabled.
- Added `benchmark/address_benchmark.dart`, which compares G and M parsing
  throughput on the Dart VM and dart2js. Results are in `benchmark/README.md`.
- Expanded `SafeRoutingId.tryParse` tests for malformed numeric input and
  uint64 boundaries.

## 1.1.0

- **Flutter Web precision safety for 64-bit routing IDs.**
  - Added `SafeRoutingId`, a BigInt-backed wrapper that parses, validates,
    compares, and serializes MEMO_ID / muxed routing IDs as exact decimal
    strings — never through `int`/JS `Number` — so IDs above
    `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (`2^53 - 1`) up to the uint64 ceiling
    (`2^64 - 1`) are never silently truncated in browser contexts.
  - Added conditional-compilation platform probe: `isWebJsRuntime` is
    `true` only when compiled to JavaScript (Flutter Web / dart2js / DDC).
  - Added web-safe accessors on `RoutingResult`: `idString` (exact canonical
    decimal string) and `safeId` (`SafeRoutingId` wrapper).
  - `SafeRoutingId.fromInt` refuses values above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
    on web builds instead of propagating an already-truncated JS `Number`.
  - MEMO_ID / MEMO_TEXT uint64 range validation now goes through the
    string-exact `SafeRoutingId` parser (behavior unchanged on all platforms).
  - New Flutter Web test vectors (`test/web_compat/routing_id_web_test.dart`,
    run with `dart test test/web_compat --platform chrome`) covering the
    2^53-1, 2^53, 2^53+1, 2^63-1, 2^63, and 2^64-1 boundary IDs through
    memo extraction, muxed decode, and JSON serialization.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release of the Bluewhale for Dart and Flutter.
- Support for G, M, and C address detection and validation.
- Support for SEP-0023 Muxed Address encoding and decoding.
- Routing extraction logic for reconciling incoming payments.
